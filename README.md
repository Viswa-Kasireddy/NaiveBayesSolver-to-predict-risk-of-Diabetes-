# NaiveBayesSolver-to-predict-risk-of-Diabetes-
/*
 * Objective: The goal of this program is to use machine learning to predict whether a given patient is at risk for Diabetes or not.
* The Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm uses training data to analyze the Main Classifier of Diabetes and the Attribute Classifiers of the data 
* (weight, blood sugar, physical activity) in order to predict a patient's risk for diabetes. 
* 
* Ex : Training data input: Attributes like weight ( obese,overweight,underweight,normal), activity level ( active, moderate,poor) .. etc 
* and also  each record classified as diabetes yes or no.
* Ex:input: that needs to be computed for the likelihood of diabetes: 
*           (under,BS_high,AC_high) underweight, high blood sugar levels, high activity levels
* Ex output: has HIGH likelihood of developing diabetes in the near future
